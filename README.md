## **Overview**  
The **Simon Says Game** is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order. This project is a great way to explore basic web development concepts, including **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  

## **Features**  
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players follow and repeat a sequence of colors.  
- **Level Progression**: The sequence increases in length with each level.  
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.  
- **Sound Effects**: Provides audio feedback for correct and incorrect sequences.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web page.  
- **CSS**: Styles the application, making it visually appealing.  
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic and user interactions.  

## **How It Works**  

### **Game Process**  
1. The game starts when the player clicks the "Start" button.  
2. The game generates a random sequence of colors, starting with one color.  
3. The color flashes in a sequence, and the player must remember the order.  
4. The player clicks the buttons to repeat the sequence.  
5. If the sequence is correct, a new color is added to the sequence, and the next round starts.  
6. If the player makes a mistake, the game plays an error sound, and the sequence resets.  
7. The player must repeat the sequence correctly to progress.  

### **JavaScript Logic**  
- **Sequence Generation**:  
  - A random color is selected and added to the sequence.  
  - The game flashes the sequence to the player.  
- **User Interaction**:  
  - The player clicks buttons to repeat the sequence.  
  - The game listens for clicks and checks them against the correct sequence.  
- **Feedback System**:  
  - If correct, the sequence continues with an additional color.  
  - If incorrect, the game plays an error sound and resets.  
- **Game Progression**:  
  - Each round adds a new color, increasing difficulty.  
  - The game continues until the player makes a mistake.
